# Check Yo'Self
## Created by Elyse Myers
### Summary
This is the fourth and final project of Module 1 at the Turing School of Software & Design. Check Yo'Self is a project that focuses on continuing to develop the skills of writing semantic HTML, clean & organized CSS and DRY JavaScript. It continues to focus on concepts of DOM manipulation, as well as client-side data persistence using localStorage. Check Yo'Self also introduces the fundamentals of object oriented programming with a focus on encapsulation.
### Overview
Check Yo'Self is an application designed to manage all of your to-do lists. You can add a title and tasks to be completed to create a new to-do list. Each task can be individually checked off to mark it as complete. When all tasks have been completed the to-do list can then be deleted. To-do lists that are time sensitive can be marked as urgent by utilizing the urgent button on the to-do list card. As the user you also have the added capability of filtering all cards by urgency and can also search to-do list titles to find the exact list you may be in search of.
